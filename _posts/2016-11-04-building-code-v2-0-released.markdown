#### Building Code Updates

__1.0.9__ <u>International system of units</u> shall be used in all design submissions, including but not limited to drawings, project manuals, and other related documents. Other systems of units are optional for reference purpose.

__2.0.1__ Adopted Chinese building codes were updated.

__3.0.4__ Definition of _Non-Combustible Component_ was updated.

__3.0.5__ Definition of _Difficult-Combustible Component_ was updated.

__3.0.6__ Definition of _Combustible Component_ was provided.

__4.1.2__ Fire resistance rating requirements for building components were updated.

__4.1.3__ Table 5. Combustibility grades for _Floor_ and _Partition_ were updated.

__4.1.5__ Exterior <u>fire escape</u> stairs are prohibited.

__4.2.3__ Table 6. Maximum permitted area of safety glass was updated.<br>
e. (ii). Frameless glass in the bathroom shall be tempered glass conforming to the provisions in Table 6 and with nominal thickness of no less than <del>5mm</del>`12mm`.

__4.3.6__ For the treads and risers of <u>indoor</u> stairways, the depth shall be no less than `0.26m`, and the height shall be no more than `0.175m`.<br>
For the treads and risers of <u>outdoor</u> stairways, the depth shall be no less than `0.30m`, and the height shall be no more than `0.15m` but no less than 0.10m.

__5.2.3__ The wind load for Dezhou shall be taken as `0.45kN/m2`.<br>
At 10m above the ground, 10-minute average annual maximum wind speed is about `26.86m/s`.<br>
When it is predicted that the wind velocity may exceed `26.86m/s`, a notice for forcible withdrawal (evacuation order) will be issued.

__5.2.4__ In Dezhou, the earthquake-resistant fortification intensity is `7`, and the design basic acceleration is `0.10g`.

__5.2.5__ In Dezhou, the snow load shall be `0.35kN/m2`, and the coefficient division of quasi-permanent value for snow load shall be `II`.

__5.2.6__ The horizontal load on the railing tops of stairs, stands, balconies, accessible roofs, etc. shall be set as `1.0kN/m2`. The vertical load shall be set as `1.2kN/m2`.

__6.1.3__ Fire suppression sprinkler systems are not required. The municipal water distribution system does not provide fire demand on site. Otherwise, the participating buildings have to define their own fire water tanks.

__6.2.8__ Water closets shall be <u>fully functional</u>, and shall be <u>connected to</u> the water supply and the sewage disposal systems.

__6.3.2__ The hydrostatic pressure of water supply <del>before</del>`after` the threshold water meter in the building shall be no less than <del>0.05</del>`0.1MPa`, and the water supply pressure of the service pipe shall be no more than 0.35MPa.

__6.7.1__ Domestic water not in contact with the human body, such as water for landscapes, greening, vehicle washing, road watering, toilet flushing, etc. <del>shall</del>`is recommended to` make use of the non-traditional water sources such as urban recycled water, rainwater, building reclaimed water, etc.

__8.3.5__ All power receptacles shall be safety receptacles.

__8.4.2__ The efficiency of interior lighting shall not be less than 70%. For shaded interior lighting, the efficiency shall not be less than 60%. The average luminous efficiency of light sources shall not be less than 60lm/W.

__8.5.3__ Metallic conduits and <del>plastic</del>`PVC` conduits may be used for distribution circuit wiring in houses. The tube wall thickness of concealed metallic conduits shall be no less than 1.5mm, and the tube wall thickness of concealed <del>plastic</del>`PVC` conduits shall be no less than 2.0mm.
