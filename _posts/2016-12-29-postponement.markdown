Dear Teams,

The Organizing Committee of Solar Decathlon China hereby regrets to announce that the finals of Solar Decathlon China will be postponed to early 2018.

This unwanted decision is a consequence of the time conflict between the finals of Solar Decathlon China and the major national foreign activities of the country in 2017, which will significantly restrict the scale, quality and influence of the event. After consulting with the the National Energy Administration and Dezhou city, we regrettably inform you this postponement notice. The Organizing Committee is actively making arrangements for 2017 in order to help teams go through this transition smoothly.

The second workshop of Solar Decathlon China will be held on time and more details will be discussed with faculty leaders of each team in Dezhou.

Please feel free to contact us if there are any questions.

Yours truly,

Organizing Committee of Solar Decathlon China
